## Introduction to Terraform

### Terraform
is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that lets you define, provision, query and manage cloud resources using a declarative configuration language. Instead of clicking through the AWS console or writing complex API calls, you write code that describes your desired infrastructure, and Terraform handles all the API calls and sequencing needed to make it happen.

#### Goals for class
- Verify computer is set up correctly
- Build VPC with the extras using Terraform

#### Prereqs
-   note I am using a mac  
 
# 1. Run this command in Terminal 
- curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaron-dm-mcdonald/Class7-notes/refs/heads/main/101825/check.sh | bash

![run curl command](./screen-captures/1-run-curl.png)

for mac users seems to get stuck? It says <mark>end</mark> but you are unable to type so hit control+c to <mark>end</mark> what is running and complete the check

### What the preceeding script does

checks the following:
- AWS CLI installed, configured and authenticated
- Terraform binary is installed and up to date
- TheoWAF folder present at ~/Documents/TheoWAF/class7/AWS/Terraform
- Creates a .gitignore file

It will create the TheoWAF folder structure if needed and will download a .gitignore file configured for Terraform projects.

# 2. Got to the Terraform folder in Terminal  
cd ~/Documents/TheoWAF/class7/AWS/Terraform/  

make sure you have a .gitignore file which is created when you ran the curl command

### create a directory in Terraform  
- mkdir 10-24-25_wk6-tf-lab (working folder)  
### create files in that folder
- touch 0-auth.tf
- touch 1-vpc.tf

### copy .gitignore file from Terraform folder to working folder

Terminal view
![mkdir and 0-auth.tf and 1-vpc.tf file inside folder has gitignore file terminal view](./screen-captures/3-add-tf-files-copy-gitignore-terminalview.png)

Finder view
![mkdir and .tf file inside dir gitignore finder view](./screen-captures/4-add-tf-and-gitignore-finderview.png)


# 3. Make sure I forked Theo's github folder updated class7

![Theo's forked class7 folder](./screen-captures/5-theo-forked-class7-folder.png) 

I can add these files directly to my Terraform folder
- in github go to code and copy url
- in Terminal command "working folder"

![cloned Theo class7 folder](./screen-captures/6-theo-forked-class7-folder-terminalview.png) 

open vscode by 
- typing command "code ." in your terminal  
- then you can close the terminal and work out of vscode

![open vscode](./screen-captures/7-open-vscode.png) 

#### *alternatively the all Terraform scripts can be found in at the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers?tier=official)
- got to the AWS provider
- upper right side click use provider

![navigate to terraform registry website](./screen-captures/8-terraform-registry.png) 

- in vscode copy and paste script into the 0-auth.tf file
- *every terraform deployment will need a terraform code blocks
you should have provider blocks in every one.
- put default region under provider in the code  
>>>> "# default region  
region= "us-east-1"

you can put other things as well. take a look in the registry to learn more by going to the Documentation section beside the use provider on the website

![10 changes and unsaved](./screen-captures/10-changes.png)  
- SAVE when your done *see the white dot beside the name in editor shows that it has not been saved

### Terraform Workflow (commands)
IVPAD (init, verify, plad, apply, destroy)

|Terraform Command|Action|
|-|-|
|terraform init|Downloads provider plugins, generates lock file, etc|
|terraform validate|Validate HCL syntax and configuration (check your "grammar", not if it "makes sense" otherwise known as semantically correct)|
|terraform plan|Show execution plan: preview what will change|
|terraform apply|Apply changes: actually create/modify/destroy infrastructure|
|terraform destroy|Destroy all resources managed by this configuration. Run only when finished with the lab|

### terraform version
### terriform init

![terraform version and terraform commit](./screen-captures/11-terraformversion-terraforminit.png)
- sucessfull created a .terraform.lock.hcl file

### terraform validate
![terraform validate](./screen-captures/12-terraformvalidate.png)

now Terraform is ready to make infrastructure now we go to the 1-vpc.tf aka we've also used 1-main.tf in other classes.

- terraform website/providers/aws/documentation
- scroll down aws documentation on the left and find VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) which gives you two cloud block sublists: Resources and Data

#### Resources  
- makes things in the cloud

#### Data Sources
- searches or queries the cloud and gives you information

go to Resource
go to aws vpc
![get the script for 1-vpc.tf from registry](./screen-captures/13-1-vpc.tf-info.png)

### terraform plan
### terraform apply
- successfull created a terraform.tfstate file  

![terraform plan and terraform apply](./screen-captures/13-terraformplan-terraformapply.png)  

root VPC = 10.72.0.0/16

public A = 10.72.1.0./24  
public B = 10.72.2.0/24  
public C = 10.72.3.0/24  
public D = 10.72.4.0/24

private A = 10.72.11.0./24  
private B = 10.72.12.0/24  
private C = 10.72.13.0/24  
private D = 10.72.14.0/24

- go to class7 files and copy the script from 1-VPC.tf and past in your file  

![copy VPC script from from class7 1-VPC.tf file and past in my own](./screen-captures/14-copy-1-VPC.tf-file.png)
- changes to the script: changed app1 to main, cidr block, name, erased service, owner, planet and changed tag

![changes to the vpc script](./screen-captures/15-changes-to-vpc-script.png)
- save
- terraform validate 
- success
![validate sucess](./screen-captures/16-validate-sucess.png)
- terraform plan - *which adds the name

![terraform plan](./screen-captures/17-terraform-plan.png)
- terraform apply
>>>- it then will ask you to type 'yes' to accept

![terraform apply](./screen-captures/18-terraform-apply.png)

go to AWS to double check that your VPC was created
![vpc created in aws](./screen-captures/19-vpc-created-n-aws.png)

add a file touch 2-subnets.tf
copy and past script from subsequent class7 file into the new file
![subnet script](./screen-captures/20-subnet-script.png)

## input my information into the 2-subnets.tf

- change the availability zones. To replace all instances command+f write the zone click the dropdown menu to the left write the new zone
![how to replace all availability zones](./screen-captures/21-how-to-replace-all-text-occurences.png)

- vpc_id must match our vpc or it can't find it. I will change  *vpc_id  = aws_vpc.app1.id* to *vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id*

![script changes](./screen-captures/22-script-changes.png)

![script changes](./screen-captures/23-script-changes.png)

- eu-west-1 turns into us-east-1
- cider block has to match your cider block

![script changes](./screen-captures/24.png)

### terraform validate
### terraform plan
- don't worry about the note: you didn't use the -out option to save this plan...... will be explained at a later date
### terraform apply
- will ask if you want to accept type yes  

![terraform apply yes](./screen-captures/25-terraform-apply-yes.png)

to check go to AWS vpcs and into subnets

![built subnets in aws](./screen-captures/26-built-subnets-in-aws.png)

create new tf file 
- touch 3-IGW.tf
- touch 4-NAT.tf
- touch 5-Route.tf

![created IGW, NAT,and Route .tf files](./screen-captures/27-create-IGS-NAT-Route.png)

### copy 3-IGW.tf script to my file  
- *carefully look at your code make sure your vpc_id is correct  

![igw script fix vpc_id](./screen-captures/28-igw.png)
Save

### terraform validate  
### terraform plan  
### terraform apply 
- 'yes'  

![IVPAD IGW](./screen-captures/29.png)  

![IGW in AWS](./screen-captures/30-IGW-in-aws.png)


### copy 4-NAT.tf script to my file
- remove line 2 vpc = true *its old Theo code

![changes in nat](./screen-captures/31-changes-to-NAT.png)  
- Save

## IVPAD
### terraform validate  
### terraform plan  
### terraform apply 
- 'yes'  

![NAT](./screen-captures/33.png)

![NAT in AWS](./screen-captures/32-NAT-in-aws.png)

### copy 5-Route.tf script to my file
- change vpc_id name to match mine
- all vpc_id = aws_vpc.app1.id to vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id 
- change the availability zones
- *note route table associations attaches the route tables that you created to a subnet

SAVE

## IVPAD
### terraform validate  
### terraform plan  
### terraform apply 
- 'yes'  

![Route.tf](./screen-captures/36.png)

![VPCs](./screen-captures/34-Route.png)

![Route Tables](./screen-captures/35-Route-tables.png)

- you can see everything you've built up so far by using command terraform state list. this list everything you've built in the state file

![terraform state list](/screen-captures/

37-terraform-state-list.png)
- will ask if your sure 'yes'

![terraform destroy yes](./screen-captures/38-terraform-destroy-yes.png)
